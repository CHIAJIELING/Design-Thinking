## 📝Reflection
This project let me know that technology should be benifits to all communities. Designing for accessibility is not just add-on but is a fundamental consideration. I also learned to design stand on different perspective. I also gained new knowlegde about design thinking (empathize, define, ideate, prototype and testing). The process showed me how a good user-centereed design can create a meaningful life.
