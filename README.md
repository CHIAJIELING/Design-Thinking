# Design-Thinking: DrawSense ADHD
## 🎯What I done
For this project, my teammate and I focused on
- Report: full process on design thinking about digital solution for ADHD
- Low-Fidelity Prototype

## Overview
Prototype of DrawSense ADHD show a complete and structured screening flow had been designed to support ADHD screening process for all age. Flow guides doctors and therapists step-by-step, from patient information, behavioral quiz page, drawing task, scanning and result and managing follow-up appointments.

## Problem Statement
The healthcare provider needing to screen for ADHD in children requires an efficient and engaging, yet unbiased and digital, method to note attention and behavior patterns. A child centric drawing task and question technique, aided by artificial intelligence, provides an easy and non-intrusive way for the healthcare provider to note the necessary behavior patterns, while also offering good visual insight.

## 📝Reflection
Through this Design Thinking Project, I have learned to design stand on different perspective by understanding user emotions, behaviors and daily challenges.  I also gained new knowledge about design thinking (empathize, define, ideate, prototype and testing). I learned experience in translate ideas into real solution. From this project,  it showed me how a good user-centereed design can create a meaningful life. It also improve my problem-solving, teamwork and communication skills.
